# Streamlit-apps
This Repo is a Collection of 12 streamlit-apps

I am seeing more people use streamlit becuase it allows people to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything, without any knowledge of web development. Since I do not know web-development, I want to know more and practice using the library. 

- This is a follow allong course on the python library streamlit.
- The course is provided by [Freecodecamp.com](freecodecamp.com)
- The course is taught by [The data Professor](http://dataprofessor.org/)
- The video for the tutorial can be found on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM)
